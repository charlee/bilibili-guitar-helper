# Bilibili Guitar Helper

A userscript for Bilibili designed to assist guitarists (and other musicians) in practicing by providing essential video control features.

## Features

- **Segment Looping**: Define a specific start and end time to loop a segment of the video for focused practice.
- **Playback Speed Control**: Easily adjust the video playback speed to slow down difficult sections or speed up familiar ones.
- **Countdown Timer**: Set a countdown before the video starts playing, giving you time to get ready and grab your instrument.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Create a new script and paste the contents of `src/index.user.js` (once available).
3. Save and refresh Bilibili.
