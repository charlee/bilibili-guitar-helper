# Project: Bilibili Guitar Helper

## Description
A userscript for Bilibili that provides video control features specifically designed to help musicians practice with video tutorials.

## Core Features
- **Segment Looping**: Loop a specific part of the video for focused practice.
- **Playback Speed**: Control video playback speed for slow-motion practice.
- **Countdown Timer**: A countdown before the video starts (or resumes) to allow the player to prepare.

## Technical Details

- **Target**: Musicians/Guitarists

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Implement UI for setting start/end times for looping.
- [ ] Add playback speed controls (finer control than Bilibili's default).
- [ ] Implement a countdown timer before playback starts.
- [ ] Support keyboard shortcuts for quick control.
